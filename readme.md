Product Recommender Carousel
This JavaScript snippet sets up a product recommender carousel that allows users to view and like products dynamically fetched from an external source. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Features:
Dynamic CSS Injection:

CSS styles are injected dynamically to ensure the carousel layout is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes.
Product Data Fetching:

Uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch product data asynchronously from a specified URL when the page URL matches a target URL (https://www.lcw.com/ in this case).
HTML Structure Generation:

Once product data is fetched, the script dynamically generates HTML markup for each product including images, names, and prices. This HTML is then appended to a designated container on the page (<div class="product-detail">).
Like Functionality:

Users can like products by clicking on a heart icon associated with each product. Liked products are stored locally using localStorage, allowing users to see their liked products even after revisiting the site.
Carousel Navigation:

Includes navigation buttons (< and >) for sliding through the carousel horizontally, making it easy for users to browse through recommended products.
How to Use:
Simply include the JavaScript code in your website's <script> tags or as a separate JS file.
Ensure the target URL (https://www.lcw.com/ in this case) matches where you want to display the product recommender carousel.
Customize CSS styles or product data URLs as per your specific requirements.
Dependencies:
None. The script uses native JavaScript (no external libraries) for fetching data, DOM manipulation, and local storage management.
Compatibility:
Designed to work across modern browsers that support ES6 JavaScript features and XMLHttpRequest.
