Product Recommender Carousel
============================

This JavaScript snippet sets up a product recommender carousel that allows users to view and like products dynamically fetched from an external source. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Features
--------

*   **Dynamic CSS Injection:**CSS styles are injected dynamically to ensure the carousel layout is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes.
    
*   **Product Data Fetching:**Uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch product data asynchronously from a specified URL when the page URL matches a target URL (https://www.lcw.com/ in this case).
    
*   **HTML Structure Generation:**Once product data is fetched, the script dynamically generates HTML markup for each product including images, names, and prices. This HTML is then appended to a designated container on the page (
    
    ).
    
*   **Like Functionality:**Users can like products by clicking on a heart icon associated with each product. Liked products are stored locally using localStorage, allowing users to see their liked products even after revisiting the site.
    
*   **Carousel Navigation:**Includes navigation buttons (< and >) for sliding through the carousel horizontally, making it easy for users to browse through recommended products.
